# Podcast-human-syncer

Helps to sync "who is talking" and "who wants to talk next / now" for podcasts (without video).

# Install

1.) put 4 images for every participant into public/images

* profile_$NAME.png => showing a simple profile picture 
* done_$NAME.png => the profile picture stroke through or greyed out or faded away otherwise
* next_$NAME.png => a picture with a simple raised hand (like 'I want to say something')
* urgent_$NAME.gif => an animated picture (therefore GIF) which express the urgent need of talking ;)

2.) npm i && npm start
